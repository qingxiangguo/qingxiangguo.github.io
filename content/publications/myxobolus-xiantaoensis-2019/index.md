abstract: |
  This study describes a new myxozoan species, *Myxobolus xiantaoensis* n. sp., identified from the fins of yellow catfish (*Tachysurus fulvidraco*) in China. The parasite had previously been misattributed to *Myxobolus physophilus* in Chinese records. Integrated morphological characterization and molecular phylogenetic analyses support its taxonomic distinction and clarify historical misidentifications.
