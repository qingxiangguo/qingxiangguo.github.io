abstract: |
  This study describes a new myxozoan species, *Myxobolus xiantaoensis* n. sp., isolated from the fins of yellow catfish (*Tachysurus fulvidraco*) in China. The species had previously been misidentified as *Myxobolus physophilus* in Chinese records. Detailed morphological observations and molecular phylogenetic analyses support its taxonomic distinction.
