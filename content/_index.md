        I am a computational biologist and postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Rendong Yang's lab at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University. My research focuses on developing advanced bioinformatics algorithms, deep learning models, and multi-omic pipelines to decode the regulatory complexity of cancer genomes and transcriptomes. I am particularly passionate about leveraging third-generation long-read sequencing (e.g., Oxford Nanopore) and AI-driven methods to uncover novel structural variations and transcriptomic alterations that traditional methods often miss.

        Currently, my work centers on building computational tools that address critical bottlenecks in biomedical genomics. As a lead developer, I created toolkits like OctopuSV (*Bioinformatics*) for automated, multi-sample structural variant analysis. Furthermore, I have enjoyed collaborating with excellent colleagues on various impactful projects. For instance, I contributed to the project of DeepChopper—a genomic language model published in *Nature Communications* designed to mitigate chimera artifacts in nanopore direct RNA sequencing. Additionally, I participated in developing analytical workflows for neoantigen detection (ScanNeo2, *Bioinformatics*) and supported the analysis for discovering novel cancer regulatory mechanisms (*Science Advances*). 

        My strong foundation in algorithmic development and multi-omic integration (genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) was established during my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at Huazhong Agricultural University (completed in Jun 2021). While my early research explored evolutionary genomics and the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation, this extensive training laid the essential groundwork for my current focus on multimodal data integration in human diseases. To date, I have authored and co-authored 26 peer-reviewed publications, including works published on Nature Communications, Science Advances, Bioinformatics, BMC Biology, Biology (eight papers are first-author). 

        My long-term goal is to become an independent academic investigator advancing the intersection of AI and biomedical genomics. By designing specialized long-read and deep learning-based tools, I aim to bridge the gap between computational innovation and clinical application—ultimately enabling earlier cancer detection, precise target discovery, and the development of personalized therapies.
